# Python-Challenge

Formatting data using csv module in python

# PyBank Data.
* I started this challenge by first calculating the no of row without the header, as this would the number of the months.
* Then I calculated the total of the values in profit/losses column. This would be the net amount.
* Then I found the monthly chnage in profit/losses. 
* I compared the current value to previous value to find greatest increase and decrease.
* Sum of all chnages in profit and loss to find the average chnage. 
* Then Printed the output in a txt file to analysis folder.

# Pypoll Data.
* Counted the total number of votes by counting all the rows.
* Setting a list to find new values in colum 2 and then append it to list to find all the candidates in the data.
* Calculating the number to times candiadte name appeared in list to find the total number of votes casted to each candidate.
* Append the name and the number of votes to candidate summary
* Found percentage of candidate votes by diving their votes by total no of votes.
* Declared out of all the data and printed the output.
